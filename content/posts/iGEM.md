I want to tell you the story of my experience as iGEM team leader.
What is iGEM?
The **i**nternational **g**enetically **e**ngineered **m**achine student research competition 2019.
I will stick with iGEM, if you don't mind.

Science is a fine thing, when you learn about it. First you hear about those cool things in school, later you see them all over the media and then you get a deeper understanding in university. 

But its all still theory. And after some time, I got tired of the theory. The practical lab training was interesting, but not enough. Still it mostly is about students following protocols without too much thinking and sometimes only later realizing what we actually did there.

I wanted more and so I approached the joint iGEM team from my universities, the Graz University of Technology and the University of Graz, in 2018. I participated in some of the planning and especially the human practice part, which certainly helped me later. But I had to leave the team by the end of the summer semester when only little work was done, as my [summer job]({{< ref "summer18.md" >}}) started early. I do not regret that job, after all it was one of the toughest but best experiences in my life.

In 2019 I was one of the first members. I became team leader, when it became more and more obviuos that the current team leader had to much to do. This was a very new situation for me, as I have never before been the leader of any team and I took it very seriously. Maybe even too seriously.

However, I enjoyed it, despite the difficulties. I expected them and saw them as an opportunity to improve myself. I promised my team to lead them to a gold medal and maybe even more. But I did *not* expect that we would win as much as we did. That was an honor and a surprise - one of the best feelings I had in my life.

When I announced that I would be ready to undertake the task of the team leader, however, we struggled with financial difficulties, the shipment of important samples was delayed and we were understaffed in the microbiological lab. It was a tough summer.

With more energy that I thought I managed the project and planned one of the key parts of our project, the human practices. We had a steady contact with the beekeeping association to develop our idea. Beside that I worked in the lab, what I could use for my Bachelor thesis later and held weekly meetings, in an attempt to hold the team together. As we were interdisciplinary and worked in different institutes with many members doing other things beside iGEM, we were in danger of loosing our focus. Furthermore, iGEM specified several achivements, which put us under even more pressure.

In the course of the summer, our naive enthusiasm wore off a bit and we became more humble. We reduced our goals so that they would meet our capabilities and in the end we did it. We got our last and long-awaited results two days before the "wiki freeze", the deadline for documenting our achivements online. Talking to the people at the congress in Boston we learned, that many shared a similar story, some even crazier than ours.

Some of my colleagues were especially eager to make a team video and so after a long time of planning and shooting scenes, we had this masterpiece.

It was also shown in Boston during the congress, together with other teams' videos. You can find [many more of them](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=igem+2019+song) on youtube, the best ones are song parodies. Some of them really capture the iGEM feeling. When 3000 people laugh at the exact same moment, you feel the connection: they have gone through the same.
