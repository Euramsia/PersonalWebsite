The international genetically engineered machine student research competition 2019.
I will stick with iGEM, if you don't mind.

Science is a fine thing, when you learn about it. First you hear about those cool things in school, later you see them all over the media and then you get a deeper understanding in university. 

But its all still theory. And after some time, I got tired of the theory. The practical lab training was interesting, but not enough. Still it mostly is about students following protocols without too much thinking and sometimes only later realizing what we actually did there.

I wanted more and so I approached the joint iGEM team from my universities, the Graz University of Technology and the University of Graz, in 2018. I participated in some of the planning and especially the human practice part, which certainly helped me later. But I had to leave the team by the end of the summer semester when only little work was done, as my [summer job]({{< ref "summer18.md" >}}) started early. I do not regret that job, after all it was one of the toughest but best experiences in my life.

I was the leader of the 2019 iGEM team for NAWI Graz.



Some of my colleagues were especially eager to make a team video and so after a long time of planning and shooting scenes, we had this masterpiece.

It was also shown in Boston during the congress, together with other teams' videos. You can find [many more of them](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=igem+2019+song) on youtube, the best ones are song parodies. Some of them really capture the iGEM feeling. When 3000 people laugh at the exact same moment, you feel the connection: they have gone through the same.
