I was the leader of the 2019 iGEM team for NAWI Graz.

Some of my colleagues were especially eager to make a team video and so after a long time of planning and shooting scenes, we had this masterpiece.

It was also shown in Boston during the congress, together with other teams' videos. You can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=igem+2019+song">many more of them</a> on youtube, the best ones are song parodies. Some of them really capture the iGEM feeling. When 3000 people laugh at the exact same moment, you feel the connection: they have gone through the same.
