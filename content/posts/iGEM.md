I want to tell you the story of my experience team leader of [iGEM NAWI Graz 2019](http://www.igem-graz.at/2019/).
What is [iGEM](https://igem.org/Main_Page)?
The ***i**nternational* ***g**enetically* ***e**ngineered* ***m**achine* student research competition 2019.
I will stick with iGEM, if you don't mind.

**In essentia**

- I was leader of the team *iGEM NAWI Graz 2019*.
- We developed a method for the early detection of American foulbrood, a bee disease.
- We won the awards for best diagnostics project and best human practices and were nominated for finalists, best poster and best presentation among about 80 overgraduate teams we were competing with.
- We learned *a lot*

**The beginning**

Science is a fine thing, when you learn about it. First you hear about those cool things in school, later you see them all over the media and then you get a deeper understanding in university. 

But it is all still theory. And after some time, I got tired of the theory. The practical lab training was interesting, but not enough. Still it mostly is about students following protocols without too much thinking and sometimes only later realizing what we actually did there.

I wanted more and so I approached the joint iGEM team from my universities, the Graz University of Technology and the University of Graz, in 2018. I participated in some of the planning and especially the human practice part, which certainly helped me later. But I had to leave the team by the end of the summer semester when only little work was done, as my summer job started early. I do not regret that job, after all it was one of the toughest but best experiences in my life.

In 2019, I was not sure if should participate again, but was then convinced by the founders of the 2019 and became one of the first members. I later became team leader, when it became more and more obviuos that the current team leader had to much to do. This was a very new situation for me, as I have never before been the leader of any team and I took it very seriously. Maybe even too seriously, but I had promised my team to "lead them to a good rating and maybe even more", so it was a matter of honor to deliver! And despite all the new and unexpected difficulties I enjoyed it most of the time and and look now back to it as one of the formative experiences of my life.

**My team**

Some of my colleagues were especially eager to make a team video and so after a long time of planning and shooting scenes, we had this masterpiece.

It was also shown in Boston during the congress, together with other teams' videos. You can find [many more of them](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=igem+2019+song) on youtube, the best ones are song parodies. Some of them really capture the iGEM feeling. When 3000 people laugh at the exact same moment, you feel the connection: they have gone through the same.

For me personally, leading was probably the most unusual part of the whole project and really a step out of my comfort zone. I cannot write about my final conclusions, as I am still processing and understanding what happend, what I did and what I could have done. This is no short process and reaches deep into ones personality, if one wants to learn and grow.

**The work**

When I announced that I would be ready to undertake the task of the team leader, we struggled with financial difficulties, the shipment of important samples was delayed and we were understaffed in the microbiological lab. It was a tough summer. However, I was able to manage the project, even though it required far more effort than we expected.

Besides that, I planned and executed one of the key parts of our project, the human practices. We had a steady contact with the beekeeping association to develop our idea. Additionally, I worked in the lab and held weekly meetings, in an attempt to hold the rather loose team together. As we were interdisciplinary and worked in different institutes with many members doing other things beside iGEM, we were in danger of loosing our focus. Furthermore, iGEM requires several achivements, which put us under even more pressure.

In the course of the summer, our naive enthusiasm wore off a bit and we became more humble. We reduced our goals so that they met our capabilities, but did not let loose and in the end we did it. We completed the project just in time. We got our last and long-awaited results two days before the "wiki freeze", the deadline for documenting our achivements online. Talking to people at the congress in Boston a week later we learned that many shared a similar story, some even crazier than ours.

Finishing everything for the deadline sometimes seemed like a sheer impossible task, but in the end we did it, not everything according to our plan, but we did it. And iGEM is all about students learning science and making mistakes, in order to avoid them later in their life. Taking that into consideration we won everything we could win, but then came the presentation in Boston and everything got out of hand ...

But before I continue, let me first thank the people who supported us: Hannes Beims and Wolfgang Sch√ºhly, who were the main "intellectual contributors" and provided us with bacteria and phages - Peter Macheroux and Eda Mehmeti, who gave us access to two labs and access to the equipment necessary for our project - Marina Toplak and Julia Messenlehner and the rest of the academic staff, who supported us troughout the project. Without you this _Beeosensor_ have been possible.

Now to the climax of the project.

**The congress**

The 20 minute presentation in front of a small audience and the poster presentation went well, but never would we have imagined that we would win anything besides a gold medal. Sounds improper? The medals are not actually medals but just some kind of a grading system with bronze, silver and gold. Half of the teams "won" gold and so did we. The awards are the real thing in iGEM. When the winners were presented at the closing ceremony, we already knew we got gold and did not expect much more, as there are names like Harvard and MIT and the like. When the winners and nominees in the different categories were announced, I went through the most unreal 30 minutes of my life.

We were first nominated for the best diagnostics project and we cheered ... and then we were announced the *winners* of the best diagnostics project and we jumped up from our seats and celebrated. After the dust settled we joked about getting nominated for other awards, including best human practices, *and we were*! We proceeded joking with tears of joy and laughter in our eyes and then we were annoucned winners! At that moment, we were not just cheering anymore, we were shouting our lungs out. Months of hard work getting honored in such a way was an incredible experience. It was almost unreal, I felt invincible for half an hour, almost god-link, it seemd like anything could become true with a snap of my fingers. We were then nominated for the best presentation and the best poster. It was incredible, although at that moment it seemed only logical. Only later I found out that we were also nominated for the Grand Prize, that is the actual "gold medal", *the* prize of iGEM. The one prize 80 overgraduate teams truly competed for.
