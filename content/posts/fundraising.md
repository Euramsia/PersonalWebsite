In the summer of 2020 I was a fundraiser for the Red Cross in Germany, a job unlike any other job. In my first week I woke up every morning with one thought: This job is so strange. In the second week I got used to it and now after the sixth week I feel able to formulate what caused and still causes this feeling. 

But lets start from the beginning.


### The Red Cross in a nutshell

The Red Cross is an important aid agency in Germany with a variety of services, the main one being emergency medical services. If you have an accident, the organization most likely coming to your aid within minutes is the German Red Cross. Bavaria, the region of Germany which defines the typical "german" stereotypes with Lederhosen etc. is a bit special and therefore has its own subsection, the Bavarian Red Cross (BRK). This service is mainly paid for by the health insurances and state funding, but parts of it rely on donations from the general public, mainly the trainig and equipment of volunteers but also better general equipment and associated organizations like the water-guards.

### Fundraising in a nutshell

And this is where I come into play. I was the path, I was the canal through which the donations would flow to the local subsection of the BRK. Money does not flow freely, as everybody can imagine. When was the last time you stopped your lunch and thought "Hey, I should donate to some organization"? People don't just donate, they need a reason. For a few that is an accident, for some it is a begging letter at Chrismas and for more it is a fundraiser knocking on their door. "Hello, Grüß Gott, I'm from the Red Cross. We are here in Hintertupfing for our big support campaign."

Door-to-door fundraising is empirically shown to be the most effective and also most efficient form of convincing people to donate, if it is done professionally by agencys like [KOBER GmbH](https://deinferienjob.com/unternehmen/) with the right training and expertise. Letter campaigns sometimes barely cover their costs while our door-to-door fundraising brought the costs in tenfold and more. "This is the way how the local Red Cross can train and equip the volunteers that keep you safe, day and night!"

People want to donate. But usually this deep longing to do something good is buried under several layers of doubts, laziness and indeciciveness. Our task as fundraisers is to unveil it and bring the money where it is needed while leaving the citizen with a smile and a good feeling. That is necessay, because they can terminate their support at any time - "We are the red cross, we are known for our voluntary nature, that's why you decide with what amount you want to support us and for how long you want to support us."

## Team

Fundraising itself is no teamwork. We are not Jehovah's Witnesses who come in double packs. Everybody works on his own during the day, but the team is nevertheless a source of strength and comfort during this time, as they go through the same as you. They are the people you see when you wake up and when you go to sleep, every day, the only constant. Thinking of my team and sharing my stories in the evening has helped me quite a lot during tough hours. Also you can learn a lot from them, their mistakes, their experiences and they reassure you in your struggle.

This is a part of my team, one girl left after the first week, two more came to replace her but left as well. Often only half the initial team is the same after five weeks, so we were lucky to have each other until the end. Yes, fundraising is tough.

### Tough and a little bit strange

Based on my six weeks of experience I will crystallize what I find so special about door-to-door fundraising.


**The job is almost 24/7.**
If you do not dream of it then you are lucky, then it is only 16/7. From the time when you arrive at the accommodation to the time when you leave there is almost no private and social life anymore. Every minute you are not working you spend with your team, either talking about fundraising or training. In the morning you get up at around 8:30, prepare, are brought to the area where you will be for the day, work, arrive at home at 21:30, shower, train, eat, sleep and repeat. More often than not it is past midnight when you finally crawl into your bed. Only Saturday nights and Sundays bring some free time - which is of course spent with the team.


**No does not mean no.**
The first reaction of citizens usually is no. 10% of the people who donate say yes after the introduction. The rest says "no" (30%) or "no, because ..." (60%). A pure "no" is tough, with a "no, because ..." you can work. A rule of thumb is: The first no is a reflex, the second no are doubts and the third no may reveal the real unwillingness to donate. Learning to go on with convincing the 90% is essential for the success of a fundraiser. It requires a certain resilience, because it can be very demoralizing if you hear so many no's in a row and still have to push back every time calmly and/or charmingly and/or energetically, depending on your style.


**Only the performance counts, yet there is no stress.**
The job is 100% commission based and thus performance based, but there is no stress or pressure, no tasks you need to complete. You get your money for a successful donation which requires a talk and the completion of a form. That takes between 5 and 30 minutes, depending on the citizen you are talking with. How many of those donations you bring in, on how many doors you knock, if you rest for half an hour during the day or 3 hours is completely up to you. It is like piecework, but a very talent-based.


**Success seems almost random in the beginning.**
Some days are bad, some days are good and it is difficult to grasp what causes the fluctuation. The team leader is an experienced fundraiser and trains the newbies during the first weeks, but still it is not easy to understand what is good and what is bad and how to improve. That can be very frustrating, but it feels great when you have success, when you are "writing door after door".


**It is honorable work with banal motivs.** The good cause gives a comfortable feeling and you can see yourself as the good guy, but really, it is about the commissions, because that is the only money you will get. However, in the first five weeks Kober will pay at least 360€ per week regardless of your performance and will cover all costs except food. The commissions are the reason why you knock at door after door, while sweating from the heat reflected by the asphalt and the concrete buildings, when the rain is dropping from the hair into the eyes, while being hit by the smell from a stinky flat, while trying to drown the barking of a dog, after being treated in less-than-nice manner. There is a reason why the Red Cross does not send volunteers to raise their funds.

## Lessons learned

- It is all about mindset. Fundraising really helped me to realize that deeply.
- Everybody has his own style. When it comes about bringing the best performance, everybody needs to find his own way of doing things, otherwise it will only be mediocre.
- Stereotypes can be true, if they are differentiated enough. You will find rich people unwilling to donate even a small amount and rich people who give quite freely. One stereotype for rich people is therefore not enough, but with two you can classify them at least better than random and that's already something. It helps you adapting the conversation quickly to the citizen.
