[[yet to be edited and expanded]]

Everybody has a wake-up call in his life. These can be very different things. For some it is people they meet, for some it is livinh in a new city, sometimes its sd extreme as a near-death experience. For me it was working for a summer in the Dolomites.

I had worked before, at home, at the farm of my parents, as an internship at my school, but never was it really focused. This changed when i decided against [iGEM 2018]({{< ref "iGEM.md" >}}) and for working as a waiter at the [Plattkofelhütte](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattkofelhütte), also due to financial reasons. I expected it to be tough, but I was quite sure that I could do it, to be honest, I had little doubts that I could manage whatever was coming. Maybe I am just so sure about this because I have seen too little of the world yet.

The restaurant was located at 2300 meters above sealevel at the foot of the *Plattkofel*, the "flat peak". Nothing too speical in South Tyrol, which is crowded with tourists. The location is very beautiful with a great view and a vibrant feeling of mountainness. During the day the hiking trails were often crowded, but in the evening peace settled with the day trippers back in the valley and the few others enjoying the comfort of the so called "mountain refuges". Actually, many of them are more like one- or two-star-hotels.

The toughness of work depended very much on how many people we had to serve. At the best day we had about one thousand guests (guess based on the meals we served). Some few days were almost lonely, but most of the time we were very well attended. The distribution pattern was very clear. The most people came, when the forecast and the weather were good. When the forecast was bad and the weather was good or vice versa, there were less hikers and the least guests we had when the forecast promised bad weather and it actually was bad. The worst days were those with good forecast and bad weather, because then still a lot people were hiking and at the same time we could not serve outside and all the people were stuffed inside blocking everything while we needed to hurry, steaming from the rain and sweat, bringing the relative air humidity to at least 100%, some dogs adding their gorgeous wet smell, the floor dirty and the atmosphere quite tense, at least more than usually.

But most of the times the weather was nice and that also meant that I could go for a run after work. Almost every second day, when my shift ended at 6 PM, I enjoyed the most beautiful routes I have ever run. Even thought the selection was limited - you can only run on the handful of paths - it never got boring. Sometimes it was quite painful, but the location and the view always overcompensated for that. On one of my biking-running-trips I took this picture of the Plattkofel - probably my favourite one.

The time passed and after some time with too little sleep and too much effort I noticed my strenght dwindling and had to reduce my trips, but by then I had already sucked up the spirit of that place. I have seen it, how few else have seen it, day to day, with every weather, covered in centimeters of hail in June, decimeters of snow in August, flooded and dry, in daylight and moonlight, spilling over with tourists and completly deserted. Never before have I felt connected to a place so deeply, besides the farm where I grew up.

...

And the sun sets over the summer '18, but it will never fade in my memories.
