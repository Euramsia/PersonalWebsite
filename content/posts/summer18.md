Everybody has a wake-up call in his life. These can be very different things. For some it is people they meet, for some it is a new city, sometimes its a near-death experience. For me it was work.

I had worked before, at home, at the farm of my parents, as an internship at my school, but never was it really focused. This changed when i decided against [iGEM 2018]({{< ref "iGEM.md" >}}) and for working as a waiter, also due to financial reasons. I expected it to be tough, but I was quite sure that I could do it, to be honest, I had little doubts that I could manage whatever was coming. Maybe I am just so sure about this because I have seen too little of the world yet.

The restaurant was located at 2300 meters above sealevel at the foot of the *Plattkofel*, the "flat peak". Nothing too speical in South Tyrol, which is crowded with tourists. The location is very beautiful with a great view and a vibrant feeling of mountainness. During the day the hiking trails were often crowded, but in the evening peace settled with the day trippers back in the valley and the few others enjoying the comfort of the so called "mountain refuges".

An the sun sets over the summer '18, but always will I see it as the wakeup call of my life.
