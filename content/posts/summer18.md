Everybody has a wake-up call in his life. These can be very different things. For some it is people they meet, for some it is a new city, sometimes its a near-death experience. For me it was work.

I had worked before, at home, at the farm of my parents, as an internship at my school, but never was it really focused. This changed when i decided against [iGEM 2018]({{< ref "iGEM.md" >}}) and for working as a waiter at the [Plattkofelhütte](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plattkofelhütte), also due to financial reasons. I expected it to be tough, but I was quite sure that I could do it, to be honest, I had little doubts that I could manage whatever was coming. Maybe I am just so sure about this because I have seen too little of the world yet.

The restaurant was located at 2300 meters above sealevel at the foot of the *Plattkofel*, the "flat peak". Nothing too speical in South Tyrol, which is crowded with tourists. The location is very beautiful with a great view and a vibrant feeling of mountainness. During the day the hiking trails were often crowded, but in the evening peace settled with the day trippers back in the valley and the few others enjoying the comfort of the so called "mountain refuges". Actually, many of them are more like one- or two-star-hotels.

The toughness of work depended very much on how many people we had to serve. At the best day we had about one thousand guests (guess based on the meals we served). Some few days were almost lonely, but most of the time we were very well attended. The distribution pattern was very clear. The most people came, when the forecast and the weather were good. When the forecast was bad and the weather was good or vice versa, there were less hikers and the least guests we had when the forecast promised bad weather and it actually was bad. The worst days were those with good forecast and bad weather, because then still a lot people were hiking and at the same time we could not serve outside and all the people were stuffed inside blocking everything while we needed to hurry, steaming from the rain and sweat, bringing the relative air humidity to at least 100%, some dogs adding their gorgeous wet smell, the floor dirty and the atmosphere quite tense, at least more than usually.

An the sun sets over the summer '18, but always will I remember it as the wake-up call of my life.
