![Me](/meinbild.jpg)


This is me.

Student, writer, thinker.

My ambition is to change the world, and change it to the better. To my disappointment I had to find out that changing the world is harder than I imagined in my early dreams.

This, however, is no reason to give up and here I am - on my way.

After finishing the secondary education in South Tryrol with a focus on agriculture, I started my Bachelor studies at the Graz University of Technology. Molecular biology is said to be the science of the 21st century, as disruptive as informatics has been for the 20th century, so this is the right place for me.

To satisfy my deep interest in the human mind I decided to choose a neuroscience programme for my Master's degree. And that is where my path will lead me in the following two years.
