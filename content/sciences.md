|  (Sociology)   |      ()       |
|  (Pychology)   |      (trying to understand the human mind, which shows extemely complex patterns on an individual level)       |
|  Biology   |      focusing on the chemistry of living beings and trying to see the whole picture       |
|  Chemistry   |      using generalized concepts of physics to explain how the world around us changes       |
|  Physics   |      at the basis, building the foundational function of energy and matter       |

Psychology and even more so sociology are detached from the scientific basis and especially sociology leans quite heavily towards philosophy.

According to this concept, every higher level could be fully explained by any lower level. Wheter this is true or not is disputed. If it is true, physical determinism is true, meaning that every single event can in theory be determined and calculated. The outcome of an election could be known by calculating the properties of every force and subatomic particle.

In chemistry and biology, this determinism is generelly accepted as a working hypothesis. On these two levels this physical determinism is *accurate enough*. Wheter it is true or not probably
