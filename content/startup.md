Founding a startup is for me the most direct and appealing way of initiating change in the world. I am very interested in founding, co-founding or participating in a startup of any kind. Of course, I am particularly interested in bio-startups.

With [my iGEM-team]({{< ref "iGEM.md" >}}) I came in contact with the concrete idea and the adventure-feeling of a startup, when we planned how to turn our competition research project into a business. We calculated the costs and developed several business models. We reached out to professors and to stakeholders for their opinion.

After the congress in Boston however, I decided to turn to neuroscience and to leave Graz. Other members still pursue the goal to turn our *beeosensor* into a viable product and I wish them the best luck. I will keep you updated about their progress.

My own startup has to wait for some more time. But it will not wait forever.
