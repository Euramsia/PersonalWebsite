I am very interested in founding, co-founding or participating in a startup of any kind. I am of course particularly interested in bio-startups and will use any reasonable opportunity to create a business.

With my {{< ref "/posts/iGEM.md" >}}iGEM-team I came in contact with the concrete idea and the adventure-feeling of a startup, when we planned how to turn our competition research project into a business. We calculated the costs and developed several business models. We reached out to professors and to stakeholders for their opinion.

After the congress in Boston however, I decided to turn to neuroscience and to leave Graz. Other members still pursue the goal to turn our *beeosensor* into a viable product and I wish them the best luck. I will keep you updated about their progress.

My own startup has to wait for some more time. But it will not wait forever.
