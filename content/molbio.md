What is molecular biology - or molbio as it is called - all about?

**Short excursion in the history of biology.**

Living things surround humans ever since and were thus the object of curiousity. Biology has some pretty obvious domains, like plants and animals and how they behave and what grows where and what doesn't and which herb cures which diseases. Thousands of years of observations, secretes from druid mouth to druid ear and farmer's wisdom. But all this old knowledge hit against a wall, when it came to _understanding_ the phenomena that were observed. Even worse where the attempts to explain it philosophically or religously. Many scholars from ancient times tried their best in explaining why things happen by mixing the living things - biology and psychology - with the dead things - chemistry and phsyics - all of them held together by philosophy and mathematics.

Only with the rise of modern science, after a long while the veil over the secret of life was lifted, bit by bit, finding by finding, in many scholarly disputes and the veil was found to be bigger and bigger and even bigger than it was ever imagined and so we are still looking for answers to more and more questions.

I would not claim to explain the human mind and consciousness, as this is neither my expertise (so far) nor is it understood well enough. This is different however for biology and over the last centuries a deeper understanding of how *living* works has been developed.

**Sciences as I seem them**

Sciences can be seen as layers of a will to understand it all:
| Heading | Another heading |
| :----:  | :-------------: |
|  (Sociology)   |      ()       |
|  (Pychology)   |      (trying to understand the human mind, which shows extemely complex patterns on an individual level)       |
|  Biology   |      focusing on the chemistry of living beings and trying to see the whole picture       |
|  Chemistry   |      using generalized concepts of physics to explain how the world around us changes       |
|  Physics   |      at the basis, building the foundational function of energy and matter       |

Psychology and even more so sociology are detached from the scientific basis and especially sociology leans quite heavily towards philosophy.

According to this concept, every higher level could be fully explained by any lower level. Wheter this is true or not is disputed. If it is true, physical determinism is true, meaning that every single event can in theory be determined and calculated. The outcome of an election could be known by calculating the properties of every force and subatomic particle.

In chemistry and biology, this determinism is generelly accepted as a working hypothesis. On these two levels this physical determinism is *accurate enough*. Wheter it is true or not probably reai

**Molecular biology**

Biology consists of many different fields and approaches, but when I talk about molecular biology here I mean the basis of life beyond what is visible with the bare eye. I will spare you further explanations on the different subsections and want to focus on the chemical foundations of biology, which was the content of my study, even tough it is called "molecular biology".

**Abstract of a science**

Life is a state of complex order in a hostile environment, and so life needs a *defined space* withing borders. These are cell walls and cell membranes. Inside molecules can interact undisturbed in a controlled manner.

Life needs *building blocks*, and it needs the percectly right building blocks. They do not simply exist, ready to be used by anybody, but must be created. Reacting to the outside world mostly works by creating new blocks or using the ones built. 

Life needs *information*, as this creation cannot not happen by chance, but is planned rigurously. This information needs to be stored and read.

Life needs *energy*. For one thing simply maintaining order requires constant care, otherwise everything tends to slide into chaos, and for another thing creating building blocks requires energy too.

These four can be seen as the main components, building life. The rest is chemisty.
For real. Living beings are made up of molecules just like everything else and so only chemistry and physics can explain what exactly happens.
