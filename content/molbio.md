Maybe you have asked yourself this question by now. Maybe you already know it, but would like to hear another opinion. In both cases you will find what you are looking for. I am going to sum up the essence of life in an easy yet comprehensive manner. 
The short answer is: Molecular biology is about explaining life.
"Life" is often also understood as the human expereince from birth to death, but that is not what this post is about. "Life" is ment as the way how *living* works biologically.
So, I will try to stick to the basics and keep it as clear as possible. I even drew a picture! So enjoy short trip through molecular biology.

**SHORT EXCURSION IN THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY**

Living things surround humans ever since and were thus the object of curiousity. Biology has some pretty obvious domains, like plants and animals and how they behave and what grows where and what doesn't and which herb cures which diseases. Thousands of years of observations, secretes from druid mouth to druid ear and farmer's wisdom. But all this old knowledge hit against a wall, when it came to _understanding_ the phenomena that were observed. Even worse where the attempts to describe it philosophically or religously. Many scholars from ancient times tried their best to explain why things happen by mixing the living things - biology and psychology - with the dead things - chemistry and phsyics - and glueing them together with philosophy and mathematics.

Only with the rise of modern science, after a long time the veil over the secret of life was lifted, bit by bit, finding by finding, in many scholarly disputes. However, the veil was found to be bigger and bigger and even bigger than it was ever imagined and so we are still looking for answers to more and more questions.

 So, lets go molecular!

**MOLECULAR BIOLOGY**

Biology consists of many different fields and approaches, but when I talk about molecular biology here I mean the basis of life beyond what is visible with the bare eye. I will spare you further explanations on the concrete definition of different subsections and want to focus on the chemical foundations of biology, which was the content of my study. So, when I talk about molecular biology here, I mean "biology on a molecular level".

Biology is just complex chemistry.

For real. Living beings are made up of molecules just like everything else and so only chemistry and physics can explain what happens and chemistry and physics alone are enough.

In a philosophers magazine I once read about philosopers talking to a biologist about life and being stunned by the fact, that there is nothing special to life. And it is true, it is just extremely complicated chemistry, as far as science can tell. No hidden force, no *vis vitae* as the old philosophers called the secret of life. This is somewhat disillusioning, but on the other hand it brings us closer to life that we have ever been.

**ABSTRACT OF A SCIENCE**

The ancient greeks already knew that life must be composed of subparts and tried to find the elements of life. They decided to stick with four, earth, fire, water and air. They were wrong, but the idea is right. Life consists of "elements" and for a better understanding it can be broken down to five basic concepts. They make up everything that we call living and basically everything we find in an organism or a cell can be assigned to one of these five "elements".

Life is a state of complex order in a hostile environment, and so life needs a **defined space** withing borders. These are cell walls and cell membranes. Inside, molecules can interact undisturbed in a controlled manner, while the vast outside could not be controlled by a cell.

Life needs **building blocks**, and it needs an incredible variety of them. They do not exist, ready to be used by anybody, but need to be created. As the rest, they are molecules, some very small, some very large. Doing anything for a cell ususally means building specific molecules and using their specific impact on other molecules. This can range from simply forming a wall to more complex things like reading information. 

Life needs **information**, as it needs a blueprint for creating molecules that did not exist before.That cannot happen by chance, but is planned rigorously. This information needs to be stored and read.

Life needs **energy**. Who doesn't? Without energy, nothing can be done. Simply maintaining order already needs constant effort, otherwise things tend to become chaotic.

Life needs something, that performs tasks with this energy. Even though chemical reacations happen all the time, you need to put in some extra **work** to get the reactions you really want and somebody needs to control this. In the case of life the wokers are called enzymes. Huge specialized molecules which can perform very specific tasks and are constantly produced by the cell.

These five can be seen as the core elements of life.

**TENENTS OF LIFE**

Information is stored in the DNA and read by enzymes in order to duplicate the DNA or to produce proteins with the information they get. This is a step-by-step process: each bit of information is a special chemical structure that is "read" and which causes the enzyme to do a certain thing. This is the reading process. At the end we either have a second string of DNA or a protein.

Proteins are huge molecules, consisting of hundreds or thousands of atoms. Water, in comparison, consists of three atoms. Proteins have two main functions. They either build a structure, a tunnel for water to flow in and out, for example. Or they can *do* things like "reading" the information of the DNA, then they are called enzymes. They are like micro-robots with a very specific task.

Enzymes do about everything that is relevant in a cell. Without them the cell could not use food, reproduce, fight off attacking cells or react to a sudden increase of temperature. They are responsible for building everything, including other proteins with the inforation of the DNA, but also the cell wall for example. Like robots they take a certain molecule and attach it to the cell wall to make it stronger. Where does the molecule come from? A bunch of other enzymes have made it. And how? By using building blocks, provided by other classes of enzymes, and energy.

Energy is key, without it nothing would work, no car moves, the internet is dead and so would be our cells. Energy is gained from chemical reactions. In principle, it is the same as burning wood, but instead of quadrillions of reactions, the cells perform only a few, which are enough for her to live. The cell also is able to store a good part of the energy in a more convenient form - like humans use the energy from power plants and store it in a battery to power a cell phone, which works perfectly fine, while the phone would be destroyed by the heat of the power plant. It is all about and clever systems and proper management of resources. All of this is done by enzymes, of course.

The enzymes then use the stored energy to perform their tasks, which are predefined by the information on the DNA, and perform them in the controllable space within the borders the cell. There we have our five elements of life in one sentence.

This is the secret. This is life.

This would be life, if it were not enormously more complex. And that means a century full of new discoveries lies ahead of us.
